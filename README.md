## Hayo!
I'm a backend developer from Spain
During my free time I love Game Developing, and currently going back and forward with projects like:
+ âš¡ A City simulation game

I also joined 3 game jams this summer, and plan to fix and update said projects. Those are:
A New Journey
First Jam ever, bottom ladder but a good warmup experience.
The Bone Zone
