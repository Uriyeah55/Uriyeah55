## Hayo! ✨
I'm a backend developer from Spain
During my free time I love Game Developing, and currently going back and forward with projects like:
+ ⚡ A City simulation game (Unity)
+ 🛰️ A Star Fox alike project (Godot)
+ 🥕 An Overcooked ripoff (Unity)
🦊🚀🍄🏙️🎖️

I also joined 3 game jams this summer, and plan to fix and update said projects. Those are:

[Game Maker's ToolKit Game Jam 2024](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2024)

Project: [A New Journey](https://github.com/Uriyeah55/ANewJourney)

First Jam ever, bottom ladder but a good warmup experience.
[Scream Secrets game jam 2024](https://itch.io/jam/scream-secrets)
Project: [The Bone Zone](https://github.com/Uriyeah55/TheBoneZone) 

Was more creative and productive here, the game scored #16 position on the creativity label 🏅
