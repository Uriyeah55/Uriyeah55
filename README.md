# Hayo! ‚ú®
## About me
I'm a backend developer from Spain
During my free time I love Game Developing, and currently going back and forward with projects like:
+ ‚ö° [A City simulation game](https://github.com/Uriyeah55/City-Simulator) (Unity)
+ üõ∞Ô∏è [A Star Fox alike project](https://github.com/Uriyeah55/FoxStar) (Godot)
+ ü•ï [An Overcooked ripoff](https://github.com/Uriyeah55/Overcooked) (Unity)

I also joined 3 game jams this summer, and plan to fix and update said projects. Those are:

[Game Maker's ToolKit Game Jam 2024](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2024)

Project: [A New Journey](https://github.com/Uriyeah55/ANewJourney)

First Jam ever, bottom ladder but a good warmup experience.

[Scream Secrets game jam 2024](https://itch.io/jam/scream-secrets)

Project: [The Bone Zone](https://github.com/Uriyeah55/TheBoneZone) 

Was more creative and productive here, the game scored #16 position on the creativity label üèÖ

Results can be checked [here](https://itch.io/jam/scream-secrets/results/creativity).

[Magical Girl Game Jam #10](https://itch.io/jam/magical-girl-game-jam-10)

Project: [Meat your destiny](https://pinksamurai.itch.io/meat-your-destiny-lettys-pandemonium)
Pending of results!
